# My Blockchain Security Journey

Learning smart contract vulnerabilities through OpenZeppelin's Ethernaut.

## Key Concepts Practiced
- **Reentrancy**: How external calls before state update can be exploited.
- **Access Control**: Bypassing `onlyOwner` in simple contracts.
- **Integer Overflow**: Risks of unchecked arithmetic in older Solidity versions.
